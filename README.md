## Construction

This calculator project is organized into three layers:

1. **MCAL (Microcontroller Abstraction Layer):** The lowest layer that abstracts the hardware details of the AVR microcontroller.
2. **HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer):** This layer provides a set of high-level functions to interact with the hardware components, enabling easier development of applications.
3. **APP (Application):** The top layer where the calculator logic is implemented.

## Supported Calculations ‚úÖ

The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It can also handle parentheses, allowing users to input complex mathematical expressions. Furthermore, the calculator supports floating-point numbers for precise calculations.

## How It Works üõ†Ô∏è

### Expression Conversion ‚û°Ô∏è

The first step is to convert the user-input mathematical expression into a standardized format.

For example, the expression `2*(1.9+0.1)` is converted to `A*(B+C)`.

### Variable Storage üìä

The converted expression is then parsed, and variables (A, B, C, etc.) are stored in an array of doubles.

In our example, A is equivalent to 2, B is 1.9, and C is 0.1.

### Infix to Postfix Conversion ‚ÜîÔ∏è

The infix expression is further converted to a postfix expression based on stack using my code in my DataStructure repository [Here](https://github.com/hamed2634/Data_Structure/tree/master/infix%20to%20postfix%20using%20stack). 

The postfix expression simplifies the evaluation process.

### Postfix Evaluation üîÑ

Finally, the postfix expression is evaluated using a stack-based approach. 

The AVR microcontroller efficiently processes each element of the expression and computes the result, adhering to the rules of the postfix notation.

This project's modular design and layered architecture make it flexible for future enhancements and adaptations.
